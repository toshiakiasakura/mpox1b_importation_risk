# Characterising global risk profiles of Mpox clade Ib importation

This repository contains the code for our paper:
> Asakura, T. R., Jung, S.-M., Jin, S., Hu, G., Endo, A., & Dickens, B. L. (2024). Characterising global risk profiles of Mpox clade Ib importation. Journal of Travel Medicine. [doi:10.1093/jtm/taae136](https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taae136)

Since we cannot upload the flight volume data, this repository is for code checking purpose.

`sim_data` branch was prepared to allow users to run the code for DRC Scenario 1 in `1r_Flight_Code.R` with a simulated sample dataset (only the data structure is same and values have no meaning).

### How to run the code
Docker environment for VS code was prepared in `.devcontainer`.
Then use `Dev containers: Reopen in Container` command in the VS code.
